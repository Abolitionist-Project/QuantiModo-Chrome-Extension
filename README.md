Track anything in seconds by just clicking the QuantiModo button in your browser!
Use Quantimodo for Chrome to effortlessly track anything! You can track your sleep, diet, medication, physical activity, and anything else that can be quantified. Just click the QuantiModo icon in your browser and enter the variable that you want to track. Then enter the value for the measurement and select the correct units. After pressing the send button data is then sent to https://quantimo.do/.

At https://quantimo.do/, this data can be combined with data from other applications, devices and electronic health records. Since the human mind is not powerful enough to retain all of the necessary information, this data integration feature is essential to identifying correlations and causal relationships.

Users will also have the option to anonymously donate their data to the Mind First Foundation, the Personal Genome Project, and other researchers in order to help facilitate the crowd-sourced observational research which will eventually lead to the eradication of mental illness.
